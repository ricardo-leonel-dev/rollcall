# CHECKPOINTS — Final State Evaluation

> In multi-agent systems, the path isn't evaluated; the destination is.
> These are the objective checkpoints a judge (human or AI) uses to decide
> if the project is healthy.

## C1 — The harness is set up

- [ ] `.harness.json` and `harness.db` exist.
- [ ] `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/conventions.md`, `docs/verification.md`, `CHECKPOINTS.md` have their TODOs filled in (not left as template placeholders).
- [ ] `./init.sh` exits 0.

## C2 — The state is consistent

- [ ] At most one feature is `in_progress` (enforced by a DB constraint — this should never actually fail).
- [ ] Every `done` feature has passing tests.
- [ ] The open session (if any) reflects real, current work — not stale leftovers from a previous session.

## C3 — The code respects the architecture

- [ ] `src/` (or this project's equivalent) only contains what's described in `docs/architecture.md`.
- [ ] The dependency policy in `docs/architecture.md` is honored.
- [ ] No loose debug `print`/`console.log` statements or TODOs without context.

## C4 — The verification is real

- [ ] Tests exist for the code that changed.
- [ ] Tests exercise real behavior, not mocks of the thing under test.
- [ ] `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l .`, and `go vet ./...` all return clean (no automated test suite configured yet — see `docs/verification.md`; update this line if one is added and `verify_command` is set).

## C5 — The session closed successfully

- [ ] No stray untracked/temporary files.
- [ ] The session was logged out via `scripts/harness.sh log-out` (not left open).
- [ ] The last feature worked on reflects its correct status.
- [ ] The closed session has a recorded `review_status='approved'` (`scripts/harness.sh status` shows it) —
      `log-out` already refuses to close a session without this, so this box failing would mean the DB was
      edited outside the harness, not a normal miss.

## C6 — SDD spec integrity (only evaluated for features with sdd=1)

- [ ] `specs/<name>/{requirements.md,design.md,tasks.md}` exist for any feature currently `spec_ready`, `in_progress`, or `done`.
- [ ] `requirements.md` uses strict EARS syntax (see `docs/specs.md`) for every requirement, each with a stable `R<n>` id.
- [ ] Every task in `tasks.md` is checked `[x]` for a `done` feature — any left `[ ]` has a documented, reviewer-accepted justification in `progress/impl_<feature>.md`.
- [ ] Every `R<n>` in `requirements.md` maps to at least one concrete, currently-passing test, verified by the reviewer directly (not taken from the implementer's claim).

---

**How to use this file:** the `reviewer` agent (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md`) iterates through each checkbox, marks
`[x]` or `[ ]`, and rejects the session closure if any box in C1–C5 is empty. C6 only applies to features with
`sdd=1` — omit it (or mark it N/A) for features that didn't opt into spec-driven development.
